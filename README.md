# JS-99
======
These are JavaScript translation of famous functional programming series Ninety-Nine Problems already done in Haskell, List, Prolog and Scala: http://leonardiwagner.github.io/js-99  

# Some solutions are missing

Yep. I did only the first ones, I would like to see the community embracing this project, and we making all together the exercises, I expect to be useful and fun!

# How to contribute sending a solution for an exercise?

The exercises and solutions are located at **/problems.json** file. I'm also checking if they're correct making tests on **/test** directory. You can also send a new solution for an answered exercise too! Just keep the previous answer(s) if it's good.

- [You can open an issue](https://github.com/leonardiwagner/js-99/issues/new) with the solution code, and I put it on project.
- You can send a PR request changing the files listed above. Tests aren't mandatory (I can do this later).

This is a new project, so I'm open to any kind of contribution or help, feel free to open an issue and talk with me.
